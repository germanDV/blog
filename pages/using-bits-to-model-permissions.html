    <h1>Using Bits To Model Permissions</h1>

    <div class="excerpt">
      <p>While looking for an excuse to use bitwise operators and do some bit manipulation, I thought it would be nice to see how we could model permissions and roles using bits.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The first thing to keep in mind is that we want a somewhat complex permissions system.
And by that I mean that <em>higher level</em> permissions do not necessarily include the <em>lower level</em> ones.
For example, if we have <em>user</em> and <em>admin</em> roles, generally, the <em>admin</em> would have all the <em>user</em>
permissions and more.</p>

<p>The reason we want to avoid this, is that for such a simple scenario, it would
be enough to assign a higher number to the <em>higher level</em> permission and then we
just need to check that the number of the actual permission is greater than or
equal to the minimum required permission to perform a given action.</p>

<p>We could of course model such scenario with bits, but it&rsquo;s more fun when the
system is a bit more complex. So, we will build a model in which permissions are
independent of each other, you&rsquo;ll see what I mean in a minute.</p>

<p>In the context of an accounting software, let&rsquo;s imagine there are four possible
actions:</p>

<ul>
<li>issue_invoice</li>
<li>process_collection</li>
<li>release_payment</li>
<li>write_entry</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on the actions above, we will create five permissions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>NONE</code> -&gt; no permissions at all, can&rsquo;t perform any actions.</li>
<li><code>INVOICER</code> -&gt; permission to <strong>issue_invoice</strong>, can issue invoices to customers.</li>
<li><code>COLLECTOR</code> -&gt; permission to <strong>process_collection</strong>, can process payments from customers.</li>
<li><code>PAYER</code> -&gt; permission to <strong>release_payment</strong>, can make payments to vendors.</li>
<li><code>COOK</code> -&gt; permission to <strong>write_entry</strong>, can (over)write journal entries.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, since we have 4 actions, we will use 4 bits to represent a
permission. On top of permissions, we will have roles. A role is simply a group
of one or more permissions. We will see this in more detail shortly, but as an example,
if a role had permissions to <strong>release_payment</strong> and <strong>process_collection</strong>, it
would look like:</p>

<pre><code>  0 1 1 0
  | | | |
  | | | |__ it does not have permission to `issue_invoice`
  | | |
  | | |__ it has permission to `process_collection`
  | |
  | |__ it has permission to `release_payment`
  |
  |__ it does not have permission to `write_entry`
</code></pre>

<p>As you probably suspected, <code>0</code> means no permission and <code>1</code> means go ahead.
Which bit of the 4 we assigned to each of the permissions/actions
has no importance, I just placed them in the same order I had listed them
before (hopefully).</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s have an enum where we can hold the permissions. As a reminder, in JS, we can type binary
numbers prepending them with <code>0b</code>.</p>

<p><em>By the way, instead of a typescript <code>Enum</code>, I will be using a plain object,
just to show an alternative.</em></p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">// permission.ts

export const Permissions = {
  NONE: 0b0000,
  INVOICER: 0b0001,
  COLLECTOR: 0b0010,
  PAYER: 0b0100,
  COOK: 0b1000,
} as const

// We can extract the keys of the Permissions object into their own type.
// we won't be using it here, but could be useful in other cases
// type PermissionKeys = keyof typeof Permissions

// Extract the values of the Permissions object into their own type.
type Values&lt;T&gt; = T[keyof T]
export type Permission = Values&lt;typeof Permissions&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>We have defined our <code>Permissions</code>, we could also have a type for <code>Role</code>. A
<code>Role</code> is just going to be an aggregation of <code>Permissions</code>, which means that
it will just be a number, but still I think that creating a type for it is going
to make thing clearer and better express intent, so let&rsquo;s do it, and let&rsquo;s also
export a function to facilitate the creation of <code>Role</code>s.</p>

<pre><code class="language-typescript">// permission.ts

...

export type Role = number


// The single `|` character is the bitwise &quot;or&quot; operator.
//     it returns 1 if any of the argument is 1,
//     it returns 0 otherwise.
//
// If we &quot;bitwise or&quot; Permissions.COLLECTOR and Permissions.PAYER, we get
//     - Permissions.COLLECTOR  -&gt;  0 0 1 0
//     - Permissions.PAYER      -&gt;  0 1 0 0
//     - Result (bitwise or)    -&gt;  0 1 1 0
export function createRole(...permissions: Permission[]): Role {
  return permissions.reduce((acc: number, p: number) =&gt; acc | p, 0)
}
</code></pre>

<p>The final piece our <em>permission</em> module is missing, is a helper to create
functions that check that a given <code>Role</code> has the correct <code>Permission</code> to perform
a certain action.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve established that a <code>Role</code> is a group of <code>Permissions</code>, so, when it comes
to checking if a <code>Role</code> has certain <code>Permission</code>, we just need to check the bit
that corresponds to that <code>Permission</code>. If the bit is <code>1</code>, we know it is
authorized; if it is <code>0</code>, it is not.</p>

<p>How to check for the value of a specific bit you ask? We use the &ldquo;bitwise and&rdquo; (<code>&amp;</code>).</p>

<p><em>Bitwise and</em> will return <code>1</code> only when both arguments are <code>1</code>. So we just need
to compare the actual <code>Role</code> with the required <code>Permission</code>. The required
<code>Permission</code> will of course have the bit we&rsquo;re looking for set to <code>1</code> (and the
rest set to <code>0</code>). If the actual <code>Role</code> has that same bit set to <code>1</code>, then we know
that <code>actualRole &amp; requiredPermission</code> will for sure be greater than zero,
because it will have one of its bits set to <code>1</code>.</p>

<p>Whether the resulting number (in decimal) is <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>4</code> or <code>8</code> will depend
on the bit we are checking, but in all cases we know it&rsquo;s going to be <code>&gt; 0</code>,
so we will use that.</p>

<pre><code>// permission.ts

...

export function satisfy(p: Permission): (r: Role) =&gt; boolean {
  return (r: Role) =&gt; (r &amp; p) &gt; 0
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let&rsquo;s create an <code>index.ts</code> file and put our <em>permission</em> module to use,
hopefully that will clarify what we&rsquo;ve done.</p>

<pre><code>// index.ts

import type { Role } from &quot;./permission&quot;
import { createRole, satisfy, Permissions } from &quot;./permission&quot;

// Create roles
const anon = createRole(Permissions.NONE)
const jr = createRole(Permissions.INVOICER)
const sr = createRole(Permissions.PAYER, Permissions.COLLECTOR)
const owner = createRole(
  Permissions.COLLECTOR,
  Permissions.PAYER,
  Permissions.INVOICER,
  Permissions.COOK
)

// Create some functions to verify permissions
const canInvoice = satisfy(Permissions.INVOICER)
const canCollect = satisfy(Permissions.COLLECTOR)
const canPay = satisfy(Permissions.PAYER)
const canCook = satisfy(Permissions.COOK)

// Let's create a function to log all permissions
function checkAllPermissions(role: Role, label: string) {
  console.log(`===== ${label} =====`)
  console.log(`Invoicer? ${canInvoice(role)}`)
  console.log(`Collector? ${canCollect(role)}`)
  console.log(`Payer? ${canPay(role)}`)
  console.log(`Cook? ${canCook(role)}`)
  console.log()
}

checkAllPermissions(anon, &quot;Anonymous&quot;)
checkAllPermissions(jr, &quot;Junior employee&quot;)
checkAllPermissions(sr, &quot;Senior employee&quot;)
checkAllPermissions(owner, &quot;Owner&quot;)
</code></pre>

<p>If we run <code>index.ts</code>, we will get something like:</p>

<pre><code>===== Anonymous =====
Invoicer? false
Collector? false
Payer? false
Cook? false

===== Junior employee =====
Invoicer? true
Collector? false
Payer? false
Cook? false

===== Senior employee =====
Invoicer? false
Collector? true
Payer? true
Cook? false

===== Owner =====
Invoicer? true
Collector? true
Payer? true
Cook? true
</code></pre>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it. Hope you like it. Use your bits wisely.</p>
